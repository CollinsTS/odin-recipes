Basic Webpage of Recipes for HTML Project

This project will be used to showcasse the skills I have gained so far in The Odin Project relating to HTML. This will include things like the basic HTML tags, using the boilerplate (hopefully from memory), links, images, lists, parapraphs etc.

I intend to come back and continue to improve on this site in the future as I continue to grow and expand my knowledge.
